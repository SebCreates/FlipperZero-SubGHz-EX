A compilation of subghz files designed for the versatile Flipper Zero device. It is important to note that these files are intended solely for educational purposes. I want to emphasize that I do not support or endorse any illegal activities. 

These files do not belong to me, but rather, I have curated this collection with a focus on being user-friendly for individuals who are new to this technology.
