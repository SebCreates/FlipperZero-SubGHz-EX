# UF-FlipperZ-SubGHz v1.0
A compilation of subghz files designed for the Flipper Zero. It is important to note that these files are intended solely for educational purposes. I want to emphasize that I do not support or endorse any illegal activities. 

These files do not belong to me, but rather I have curated this collection with a focus on being user-friendly for people who are NEW to the flipper.
